# Basics

## Graph
Let's build our first graph by defining some `nodes` and `edges`.
Nodes are the blocks and edges are the relationships between the blocks.

The data shapes require one property of `id` but you can pass `label`
or `icon` to them to show some sort of indication what it represents.

```js
const nodes = [
{
    id: '1',
    label: '1'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    label: '2'
  }
];

const edges = [
  {
    source: '1',
    target: '2',
    id: '1-2',
    label: '1-2'
  },
  {
    source: '2',
    target: '1',
    id: '2-1',
    label: '2-1'
  }
];
```

These shapes above will create two elements `1` and `2` and create
a relationship between them. Once we have this defined, we can simply
pass these properties to the `Canvas` and it will do the rest!

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { GraphCanvas } from 'reagraph';

export const MyDiagram = () => (
  <GraphCanvas
    nodes={nodes}
    edges={edges}
  />
);
```

This will render a graph like this:

<div style={{ height: 500, width: '100%', position: 'relative', margin: '0 auto', background: 'white', borderRadius: 4, border: '1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.1)', boxShadow: 'rgb(0 0 0 / 10%) 0 1px 3px 0', overflow: 'hidden' }}>
  <Story id="demos-basic--simple" />
</div>
